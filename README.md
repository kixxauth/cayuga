Cayuga System Administration and Development
============================================

This repository contains scripts and admin tools used to deploy and run my private development and support server.  I do IT consulting, infrastructure management, software integration, and application development for the cloud. My Cayuga platform is the central repository of code and configurations used to run my private server, which, in turn, manages other cloud infrastructure.  These systems are mainly deployed on Amazon Web Services and Rackspace.
